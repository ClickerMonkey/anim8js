# parsing

This directory contains functions which take input in various forms and returns instances of classes or plain objects with a defined structure.

These functions start with `$` to make it clear that they do some kind of parsing. They are exposed publicly (`anim8`) without the `$`.

Many of these functions take string input and looks up a value from a registry.
